### Quality Policy
> During Sprint 1, we will abide by the GitHub housekeeping rules outlined in canvas. This will include ensuring that all Pull Requests made to the Main branch is functioning without errors. Each PR will need thorough reviews from teammembers before approval is granted. Good coding practices will be used throughout the project, during this sprint we will remind each other of standards that we will carry out for the remainder of future sprints.

**GitHub Workflow** (start Sprint 1)
  > All members will work on their own branch, based on the main branch. This branch will use their ASUrite name with '_dev' following (ex: ASUrite_dev). When working on an assigned User Story, members will branch off their respective _dev branch to complete the work for that US. Team members will commit early and often while developing. When the work is stable and ready for review, the team member will make a PR to Main for the other two team members to review. Once reviews are added, the PR may be merged. Whenever Main is modified all members shall merge Main to their _dev branch.
