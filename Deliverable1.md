# Deliverable Information
   > Please include your answers below in a good format so it is easy for me to see. For answers to questions please use these Blockquotes. Make sure you also check the kickoff document for more details. Also make sure this thing is well formatted and the links are links in here.

## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:**

Our team is going with the bus schedule topic.

**Sprint Number:** 1

**Scrum Master**: Chase Whitehouse

**Git Master**: Andrea Schoonover

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-3)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation.

**Sprint Goal:** Your Sprint goal

We want to complete tasks that help us get familiar with the software and its functionality. Our user stories for this sprint focus on fixing small errors and modify the splash screen design to fit our topic. There are minor but impactful changes that would improve the user experience while someone is interacting with our software.

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:**  3

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:** 2
> We added two new User Stories to the first sprint.

**Why did you add these US, why do you think you can get them done in the next Sprint?**

> These fit well with our Sprint goal


**Why do you think these fit well with your Sprint goal? (details)**
> We chose to add these US because the team deemed them to be an important focus of improvement. When discussing the future functionality and look of the software, we decided these user stories would become blocks if we did not make them a higher priority. We have chunked the US into manageable tasks with practical scopes for our first Sprint.


**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**

> Yes


## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas.
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2 and Travis CI starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that).

| Date  | Who did not attend  |Meeting notes (very brief)   | Burndown Info (on track, ahead behind is enough) | TravisCI info (does the master pass) | Additional Info  |
|---|---|---|---|--|--|
|  5/29 |  n/a |  Sprint 1 planning, created user stories and ensured each team member had a clear understanding of their tasks | beginning of sprint, but on track | x | x |
|   |   |   |   |  |  |
|   |   |   |   |  |  |

### Meeting Summary:

> Add rows as needed and add the number how many meetings for each team member:

   Robert Bruice : 1/1

   Chase Whitehouse : 1/1

   Andrea Schoonover : 1/1

### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."
